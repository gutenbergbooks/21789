align = "left" alt = "I (It)" title = "I (It)">T seemes to mee strange,
and a thing much to be marueiled, that the laborer to repose himselfe
hasteneth as it were the course of the Sunne: that the Mariner rowes
with all force to attayne the porte, and with a ioyfull crye salutes the
descryed land: that the traueiler is neuer quiet nor content till he be
at the ende of his voyage: and that wee in the meane while tied in this
world to a perpetuall taske, tossed with continuall tempest, tyred with
a rough and combersome way, cannot yet see the ende of our labour but
with griefe, nor behold our porte but with teares, nor approch our home
and quiet abode but with horrour and trembling. This life is but a
<i>Penelopes</i> web, wherein we are alwayes doing and vndoing:
a&nbsp;sea open to all windes, which sometime within, sometime without
neuer cease to torment&nbsp;vs: a&nbsp;weary iorney through extreame
heates, and coldes, ouer high mountaynes, steepe rockes, and theeuish
deserts. And so we terme it in weauing at this web, in rowing at this
oare, in passing
<span class = "pagenum silent">[A2v]</span>
<!-- png 004 -->
this miserable way. Yet loe when death comes to ende our worke, when she
stretcheth out her armes to pull vs into the porte, when after so many
dangerous passages, and lothsome lodgings she would conduct vs to our
true home and resting place: in steede of reioycing at the ende of our
labour, of taking comfort at the sight of our land, of singing at the
approch of our happie mansion, we would faine, (who would
beleeue&nbsp;it?) retake our worke in hand, we would againe hoise saile
to the winde, and willinglie vndertake our iourney anew. No more then
remember we our paines, our shipwracks and dangers are forgotten: we
feare no more the trauailes nor the theeues. Contrarywise, we apprehende
death as an extreame payne, we doubt it as a rocke, we flye it as a
theefe. We doe as litle children, who all the day complayne, and when
the medicine is brought them, are no longer sicke: as they who all the
weeke long runne vp and downe the streetes with payne of the teeth, and
seeing the Barber comming to pull them out, feele no more payne: as
those tender and delicate bodyes, who in a pricking pleurisie complaine,
crie out, and cannot stay for a Surgion, and when they see him whetting
his Launcet to cut the throate of the disease, pull in their armes, and
hide them in the bed, as, if he were come to kill them. We feare more
the cure then the disease, the surgion then the paine, the stroke then
the impostume. We haue more sence of the medicins bitternes soone gone,
then of a bitter languishing long continued: more feeling of death the
end of our miseries, then the endlesse misery of our life. And whence
proceedeth this folly and simplicitie? we neyther knowe life, nor death.
We feare that we ought to hope for, and wish for that we ought to feare.
We call life a continuall death: and death the issue of a liuing death,
and the entrance of a neuer dying life. Now what good, I&nbsp;pray you,
is there in life, that we should
<span class = "pagenum">A3</span>
<!-- png 005 -->
so much pursue&nbsp;it? or what euill is there in death, that we should
so much eschue&nbsp;it? Nay what euill is there not in life? and what
good is there not in death? Consider all the periods of this life. We
enter it in teares; we passe it in sweate, we ende it in sorow. Great
and litle, ritch and poore, not one in the whole world, that can pleade
immunitie from this condition. Man in this point worse then all other
creatures, is borne vnable to support himselfe: neither receyuing in his
first yeeres any pleasure, nor giuing to others but annoy and
displeasure, and before the age of discretion passing infinite dangers.
Only herein lesse vnhappy then in other ages, that he hath no sence nor
apprehension of his vnhappines. Now is there any so weake minded, that
if it were graunted him to liue alwayes a childe, would make accompt of
such a life? So then it is euident that not simplie to liue is a good,
but well and happilie to liue. But proceede. Growes&nbsp;he? with him
growe his trauailes. Scarcely is he come out of his nurses hands,
scarcely knowes he what it is to play, but he falleth into the
subiection of some Schoolemaister: I&nbsp;speake but of those which are
best and most precisely brought&nbsp;vp. Studies&nbsp;he? it is euer
with repining. Playes&nbsp;he? neuer but with feare. This whole age
while he is vnder the charge of an other, is vnto him but as a prison.
He only thinks, and only aspires to that time when freed from the
mastership of another, he may become maister of himselfe: pushing onward
(as much as in him lies) his age with his shoulder, that soone he may
enioy his hoped libertie. In short, he desires nothing more then the
ende of this base age, and the beginning of his youth. And what else I
pray you is the beginning of youth, but the death of infancy? the
beginning of manhood, but the death of youth? the beginning of to morow,
but the death of to day? In this sort then desires he his death, and
iudgeth his life miserable: and so
<span class = "pagenum silent">[A3v]</span>
<!-- png 006 -->
cannot be reputed in any happines or contentment. Behold him now,
according to his wish, at libertie: in that age, wherein <i>Hercules</i>
had the choise, to take the way of vertue or of vice, reason or passion
for his guide, and of these two must take one. His passion entertains
him with a thousand delights, prepares for him a thousand baites,
presents him with a thousand worldly pleasures to surprize him: and fewe
there are that are not beguiled. But at the reconings ende what
pleasures are they? pleasures full of vice which hold him still in a
restles feauer: pleasures subiect to repentance, like sweete meates of
hard disgestion: pleasures bought with paine and perill, spent and past
in a moment, and followed with a long and lothsome remorse of
conscience. And this is the very nature (if they be well examined) of
all the pleasures of this world. There is in none so much sweetenes, but
there is more bitternes: none so pleasant to the mouth, but leaues an
vnsauery after taste and lothsome disdaine: none (which is worse) so
moderated but hath his corosiue, and caries his punishment in it selfe.
I&nbsp;will not heere speake of the displeasures confessed by all, as
quarells, debates, woundes, murthers, banishments, sicknes, perils,
whereinto sometimes the incontinencie, sometimes the insolencie of this
ill guided age conductes him. But if those that seem pleasures, be
nothing else but displeasures: if the sweetnes thereof be as an infusion
of wormewood: it is plaine enough what the displeasure is they feele,
and how great the bitternes that they taste. Behold in summe the life of
a yong man, who rid of the gouernment of his parents and maisters,
abandons himselfe to all libertie or rather bondage of his passion:
which right like an vncleane spirit possessing him, casts him now into
the water, now into the fire: sometimes caries him cleane ouer a rocke,
and sometime flings him headlong to the bottome. Now if he take and
followe
<span class = "pagenum silent">[A4]</span>
<!-- png 007 -->
reason for his guide, beholde on the other part wonderfull difficulties:
he must resolue to fight in euery part of the field: at euery step to be
in conflict, and at handstrokes, as hauing his enemy in front, in
flanke, and on the reareward, neuer leauing to assaile him. And what
enemy? all that can delight him, all that he sees neere, or farre off:
briefly the greatest enemy of the world, the world it selfe. But which
is worse, a&nbsp;thousand treacherous and dangerous intelligences among
his owne forces, and his passion within himselfe desperate: which in
that age growne to the highest, awaits but time, houre, and occasion to
surprize him, and cast him into all viciousnes. God only and none other,
can make him choose this way: God only can hold him in it to the ende:
God only can make him victorious in all his combats. And well we see how
fewe they are that enter into&nbsp;it, and of those fewe, how many that
retire againe. Follow the one way, or follow the other, he must either
subiect himselfe to a tyrannicall passion, or vndertake a weery and
continuall combate, willingly cast himselfe to destruction, or fetter
himselfe as it were in stockes, easily sincke with the course of the
water, or painefully swimme against the streame. Loe here the young man,
who in his youth hath drunke his full draught of the worlds vaine and
deceiuable pleasures, ouertaken by them with such a dull heauines, and
astonishment, as drunkards the morow after a feast: either so out of
taste, that he will no more, or so glutted, that he can no more: not
able without griefe to speake, or thinke of them. Loe him that stoutly
hath made resistance: he feeles himselfe so weery, and with this
continuall conflict so brused and broken, that either he is vpon the
point to yeeld himselfe, or content to dye, and so acquit himselfe. And
this is all the good, all the contentment of this florishing age, by
children so earnestlie desired, and by old folkes so hartely lamented.
Now
<span class = "pagenum silent">[A4v]</span>
<!-- png 008 -->
commeth that which is called perfit age, in the which men haue no other
thoughts, but to purchase themselues wisedome and rest. Perfit in deede,
but herein only perfit, that all imperfections of humane nature, hidden
before vnder the simplicitie of childhood, or the lightnes of youth,
appeere at this age in their perfection. We speake of none in this place
but such as are esteemed the wisest, and most happie in the conceit of
the world. We played as you haue seene in feare: our short pleasures
were attended on with long repentance. Behold, now present themselues to
vs auarice, and ambition, promising if wee will adore them, perfect
contentmẽt of the goods and honors of this world. And surely there are
none, but the true children of the Lord, who by the faire illusions of
the one or the other cast not themselues headlong from the top of the
pinnacle. But in the ende, what is all this contentment? The couetous
man makes a thousand voiages by sea and by lande: runnes a thousand
fortunes: escapes a thousand shipwrackes in perpetuall feare and
trauell: and many times he either looseth his time, or gaineth nothing
but sicknesses, goutes, and oppilations for the time to come. In the
purchase of this goodly repose, he bestoweth his true rest: and to gaine
wealth looseth his life. Suppose he hath gained in good quantitie: that
he hath spoiled the whole East of pearles, and drawen dry all the mines
of the West: will he therefore be setled in quiet? can he say that he is
content? All charges and iourneys past, by his passed paines he heapeth
vp but future disquietnes both of minde and body: from one trauell
falling into another, neuer ending, but changing his miseries. He
desired to haue them, and now feares to loose them: he got them with
burning ardour, and possesseth in trembling colde: he aduentured among
theeues to seeke them, and hauing found them, theeues and robbers on all
sides, runne mainely on
<span class = "pagenum">B</span>
<!-- png 009 -->
him: he laboured to dig them out of the earth, and now is enforced to
redig, and rehide them. Finally comming from all his voiages he comes
into a prison: and for an ende of his bodely trauels, is taken with
endlesse trauails of the minde. And what at length hath this poore soule
attained after so many miseries? This Deuill of couetise by his
illusions, and enchantments, beares him in hand that he hath some rare
and singuler thing: and so it fareth with him, as with those seely
creatures, whome the Deuill seduceth vnder couler of releeuing their
pouertie, who finde their hands full of leaues, supposing to finde them
full of crownes. He possesseth or rather is possessed by a thing,
wherein is neither force nor vertue: more vnprofitable, and more base,
then the least hearbe of the earth. Yet hath he heaped togither this
vile excrement, and so brutish is growne, as therewith to crowne his
head, which naturally he should tread vnder his feete. But howsoeuer
it&nbsp;be, is he therewith content? Nay contrarywise lesse now, then
euer. We commend most those drinks that breede an alteration, and
soonest extinguish thyrst: and those meates, which in least quantitie do
longest resist hunger. Now hereof the more a man drinkes, the more he is
a thirst, the more he eates, the more an hungred: It is a dropsie, (and
as they tearme&nbsp;it) the dogs hunger: sooner may he burst then be
satisfied. And which is worse, so strange in some is this thyrst, that
it maketh them dig the pits, and painefully drawe the water, and after
will not suffer them to drinke. In the middest of a riuer they are dry
with thirst: and on a heape of corne cry out of famine: they haue goodes
and dare not vse them: they haue ioyes it seemes, and do not enioy them:
they neither haue for themselues, nor for another: but of all they haue,
they haue nothing: and yet haue want of all they haue not. Let vs then
returne to that, that the attaining of all these deceiuable goods is
nothing else
<span class = "pagenum silent">[Bv]</span>
<!-- png 010 -->
but weerines of body, and the possession for the most part, but weerines
of the minde: which certenly is so much the greater, as is more
sensible, more subtile, and more tender the soule then the body. But the
heape of all misery is when they come to loose them: when either
shipwracke, or sacking, or inuasion, or fire, or such like calamities,
to which these fraile things are subiect, doth take and cary them from
them. Then fall they to cry, to weepe, and to torment themselues, as
little children that haue lost their play-game, which notwithstanding is
nothing worth. One cannot perswade them, that mortall men haue any other
good in this world, but that which is mortall. They are in their owne
conceits not only spoyled, but altogither flayed. And for asmuch as in
these vaine things they haue fixed all their hope, hauing lost them,
they fall into despaire, out of the which commonly they cannot be
withdrawen. And which is more, all that they haue not gained according
to the accompts they made, they esteeme lost: all that which turnes them
not to great and extraordinary profit, they accompt as damage: whereby
we see some fall into such despaire, as they cast away themselues. In
short, the recompence that Couetise yeelds those that haue serued it all
their life, is oftentimes like that of the Deuill: whereof the
ende&nbsp;is, that after a small time hauing gratified his disciples,
either he giues them ouer to a hangman, or himselfe breakes their
neckes. I&nbsp;will not heere discourse of the wickednes and mischiefes
wherevnto the couetous men subiect themselues to attaine to these
goodes, whereby their conscience is filled with a perpetuall remorse,
which neuer leaues them in quiet: sufficeth that in this ouer vehement
exercise, which busieth and abuseth the greatest part of the world, the
body is slaine, the minde is weakened, the soule is lost without any
pleasure or contentment.</p>

<p>Come we to ambition, which by a greedines of honor
<span class = "pagenum">B2</span>
<!-- png 011 -->
fondly holdeth occupied the greatest persons. Thinke we there to finde
more? nay rather lesse. As the one deceiueth&nbsp;vs, geuing vs for all
our trauaile, but a vile excrement of the earth: so the other
repayes&nbsp;vs, but with smoke and winde: the rewards of this being as
vaine, as those of that were grosse. Both in the one and the other, we
fall into a bottomles pit; but into this the fall by so much the more
dangerous, as at the first shewe, the water is more pleasant and cleare.
Of those that geue themselues to courte ambition, some are great about
Princes, others commanders of Armies: both sorts according to their
degree, you see saluted, reuerenced, and adored of those that are vnder
them. You see them appareled in purple, in scarlet, and in cloth of
gould: it seemes at first sight there is no contentment in the world but
theirs. But men knowe not how heauy an ounce of that vaine honor
weighes, what those reuerences cost them, and how dearely they pay for
an ell of those rich stuffes: who knewe them well, would neuer buy them
at the price. The one hath attained to this degree, after a long and
painefull seruice hazarding his life vpon euery occasion, with losse
ofttimes of a legge or an arme, and that at the pleasure of a Prince,
that more regards a hundred perches of ground on his neighbours
frontiers, then the liues of a hundred thousand such as&nbsp;he:
vnfortunate to serue who loues him not: and foolish to thinke himselfe
in honor with him, that makes so litle reckening to loose him for a
thing of no worth. Others growe vp by flattering a Prince, and long
submitting their toongs and hands to say and doe without difference
whatsoeuer they will haue them: wherevnto a good minde can neuer
commaund it selfe. They shall haue indured a thousand iniuries, receiued
a thousand disgraces, and as neere as they seeme about the Prince, they
are neuertheles alwayes as the Lions keeper, who by long patience, a
<span class = "pagenum silent">[B2v]</span>
<!-- png 012 -->
thousand feedings and a thousand clawings hath made a fierce Lion
familiar, yet geues him neuer meate, but with pulling backe his hand,
alwayes in feare least he should catch him: and if once in a yere he
bites him, he sets it so close, that he is paid for a long time after.
Such is the ende of all princes fauorites. When a Prince after long
breathings hath raised a man to great height, he makes it his pastime,
at what time he seemes to be at the top of his trauaile, to cast him
downe at an instant: when he hath filled him with all wealth, he wrings
him after as a sponge: louing none but himself, and thinking euery one
made, but to serue, and please him. These blinde courtiers make
themselues beleeue, that they haue freends, and many that honor them:
neuer considering that as they make semblance to loue, and honor euery
body, so others do by them. Their superiors disdaine them, and neuer but
with scorne do so much as salute them. Their inferiors salute them
because they haue neede of them (I&nbsp;meane of their fortune, of their
foode, of their apparell, not of their person) and for their equalls
betweene whome commonly friendship consistes, they enuy each other,
accuse each other, crosse each other; continually greeued either at
their owne harme, or at others good. Nowe what greater hell is there,
what greater torment, then enuie? which in truth is nought else but a
feauer <i>Hectique</i> of the mind: so they are vtterly frustrate of all
frendship, euer iudged by the wisest the chiefe and soueraigne good
among men. Will you see it more clearely? Let but fortune turne her
backe, euery man turnes from them: let her frowne; euery man lookes
aside on them: let them once be disroabed of their triumphall garment,
no body will any more knowe them. Againe, let there be apparelled in it
the most vnworthie, and infamous whatsoeuer: euen he without difficultie
by vertue of his robe, shall inherit all the honours the other had done
him. In the
<span class = "pagenum">B3</span>
<!-- png 013 -->
meane time they are puffed&nbsp;vp, and growe proude, as the Asse which
caried the image of <i>Isis</i> was for the honors done to the Goddesse,
and regard not that it is the fortune they carry which is honored, not
themselues, on whome as on Asses, many times she will be caried. But you
will say: At least so long as that fortune endured, they were at ease,
and had their contentment, and who hath three or foure or more yeeres of
happy time, hath not bin all his life vnhappie. True, if this be to be
at ease continually to feare to be cast downe from that degree,
wherevnto they are raised: and dayly to desire with great trauaile to
clime yet higher. Those (my friend) whome thou takest so well at their
ease, because thou seest them but without, are within farre otherwise.
They are faire built prisons, full within of deepe ditches, and
dungeons: full of darkenes, serpents and torments. Thou supposest them
lodged at large, and they thinke their lodgings straite. Thou thinkest
them very high, and they thinke themselues very lowe. Now as sicke
is&nbsp;he, and many times more sicke, who thinkes himselfe&nbsp;so,
then who in deed&nbsp;is. Suppose them to be Kings: if they thinke
themselues slaues, they are no better: for what are we but by opinion?
you see them well followed and attended: and euen those whome they haue
chosen for their guard, they distrust. Alone or in company euer they are
in feare. Alone they looke behinde them: in company they haue an eye on
euery side of them. They drinke in gould and siluer; but in those, not
in earth or glasse is poison prepared and dronke. They haue their beds
soft and well made: when they lay them to sleepe you shall not heare a
mouse stur in the chamber: not so much as a flie shall come neere their
faces. Yet neuertheles, where the countreyman sleepes at the fall of a
great riuer, at the noise of a market, hauing no other bed but the
earth, nor couering but the heauens, these in the middest of all this
silence
<span class = "pagenum silent">[B3v]</span>
<!-- png 014 -->
and delicacie, do nothing but turne from side to side, it seemes still
that they heare some body, there rest it selfe is without rest. Lastly,
will you knowe what the diuersitie is betwene the most hardly intreated
prisoners and them? both are inchained, both loaden with fetters, but
that the one hath them of iron, the other of gould, and that the one is
tied but by the body, the other by the mind. The prisoner drawes his
fetters after him, the courtier weareth his vpon him. The prisoners
minde sometimes comforts the paine of his body, and sings in the midst
of his miseries: the courtier tormented in minde weerieth incessantly
his body, and can neuer giue it rest. And as for the contentment you
imagine they haue, you are therein yet more deceiued. You iudge and
esteeme them great, because they are raised high: but as fondly, as who
should iudge a dwarfe great, for being set on a tower, or on the top of
a mountaine. You measure (so good a Geometrician you are) the image with
his base, which were conuenient, to knowe his true height, to be
measured by itselfe: whereas you regard not the height of the image, but
the height of the place it stands vpon. You deeme them great (if in this
earth there can be greatnes, which in respect of the whole heauens is
but a point.) But could you enter into their mindes, you would iudge,
that neither they are great, true greatnes consisting in contempt of
those vaine greatnesses, wherevnto they are slaues: nor seeme vnto
themselues&nbsp;so, seeing dayly they are aspiring higher, and neuer
where they would&nbsp;be. Some one sets downe a bound in his minde.
Could I attaine to such a degree, loe, I&nbsp;were content: I&nbsp;would
then rest my selfe. Hath he attained&nbsp;it? he geues himselfe not so
much as a breathing: he would yet ascend higher. That which is beneath
he counts a toy: it is in his opinion but one step. He reputes himselfe
lowe, because there is some one higher, in stead of reputing himselfe
high, because
<span class = "pagenum silent">[B4]</span>
<!-- png 015 -->
there are a million lower. And so high he climes at last, that either
his breath failes him by the way, or he slides from the top to the
bottome. Or if he get vp by all his trauaile, it is but as to finde
himselfe on the top of the Alpes: not aboue the cloudes, windes and
stormes: but rather at the deuotion of lightnings, and tempests, and
whatsoeuer else horrible, and dangerous is engendred, and conceiued in
the aire: which most commonly taketh pleasure to thunderbolt and dash
into pouder that proude height of theirs. It may be herein you will
agree with&nbsp;me, by reason of the examples wherewith both histories,
and mens memories are full. But say you, such at least whome nature hath
sent into the world with crownes on their heads, and scepters in their
hands: such as from their birth she hath set in that height, as they
neede take no paine to ascend: seeme without controuersie exempt from
all these iniuries, and by consequence may call themselues happie. It
may be in deed they feele lesse such incommodities, hauing bene borne,
bred and brought vp among them: as one borne neere the downfalls of
<i>Nilus</i> becomes deafe to the sound: in prison, laments not the want
of libertie: among the <i>Cimmerians</i> in perpetuall night, wisheth
not for day: on the top of the Alpes, thinks not straunge of the mistes,
the tempests, the snowes, and the stormes. Yet free doubtles they are
not whẽ the lightening often blasteth a flowre of their crownes, or
breakes their scepter in their handes: when a drift of snowe ouerwhelmes
them; when a miste of heauines, and griefe continually blindeth their
wit, and vnderstanding. Crowned they are in deede, but with a crowne of
thornes. They beare a scepter: but it is of a reede, more then any thing
in the world pliable, and obedient to all windes: it being so far off
that such a crowne can cure the maigrims of the minde, and such a
scepter keepe off and fray away the griefs and cares which houer
<span class = "pagenum silent">[B4v]</span>
<!-- png 016 -->
about them: that it is contrariwise the crowne that brings them, and the
scepter which from all partes attracts them. O&nbsp;crowne, said the
Persian Monarch, who knewe howe heauy thou sittest on the head, would
not vouchsafe to take thee&nbsp;vp, though he found thee in his way.
This Prince it seemed gaue fortune to the whole world, distributed vnto
men haps and mishaps at his pleasure: could in show make euery man
content: himselfe in the meane while freely confessing, that in the
whole world, which he held in his hand there was nothing but griefe, and
vnhappines. And what will all the rest tell&nbsp;vs, if they list to
vtter what they found? We will not aske them who haue concluded a
miserable life with a dishonorable death: who haue beheld their
kingdomes buried before them, and haue in great misery long ouerliued
their greatnes. Not of <i>Dionyse</i> of <i>Sicill</i>, more content
with a handfull of twigs to whip little children of <i>Corinth</i> in a
schoole, then with the scepter, where with he had beaten all
<i>Sicill</i>: nor of <i>Sylla</i>, who hauing robbed the whole state of
<i>Rome</i>, which had before robbed the whole world, neuer found meanes
of rest in himselfe, but by robbing himselfe of his owne estate, with
incredible hazard both of his power and authoritie. But demaund we the
opinion of King <i>Salomon</i>, a&nbsp;man indued with singuler gifts of
God, rich and welthie of all things: who sought for treasure from the
Iles. He will teach vs by a booke of purpose, that hauing tried all the
felicities of the earth, he found nothing but vanitie, trauaile, and
vexation of spirit. Aske we the Emperour <i>Augustus</i>, who peaceably
possessed the whole world. He will bewaile his life past, and among
infinite toiles wish for the rest of the meanest man of the earth:
accounting that day most happy, when he might vnloade himselfe of this
insupportable greatnes to liue quietly among the least. Of
<i>Tiberius</i> his successor, he will confesse vnto&nbsp;vs, that he
holdes the Empire as a
<span class = "pagenum">C</span>
<!-- png 017 -->
wolfe by the eares, and that (if without danger of biting he might) he
would gladly let it goe: complayning on fortune for lifting him so high,
and then taking away the ladder, that he could not come downe agayne. Of
<i>Dioclesian</i>, a&nbsp;Prince of so great wisedome and vertue in the
opinion of the world: he will preferre his voluntary banishment at
<i>Salona</i>, before all the Romaine Empire. Finally, the Emperour
Charles the fifth, esteemed by our age the most happy that hath liued
these many ages: he will curse his conquestes, his victories, his
triumphes: and not be ashamed to confesse that farre more good in
comparison he hath felt in one day of his Monkish solitarines, then in
all his triumphant life. Now shall we thinke those happie in this
imaginate greatnes, who themselues thinke themselues vnhappie? seeking
their happines in lessening themselues, and not finding in the world one
place to rest this greatnes, or one bed quietly to sleepe&nbsp;in?
Happie is he only who in minde liues contented: and he most of all
vnhappie, whome nothing he can haue can content. Then miserable
<i>Pyrrhus</i> King of <i>Albanie</i>, who would winne all the world, to
winne (as he sayd) rest: and went so farre to seeke that which was so
neere him. But more miserable <i>Alexander</i>, that being borne King of
a great Realme, and Conqueror almost of the earth, sought for more
worlds to satisfye his foolish ambition, within three dayes content,
with sixe foote of grounde. To conclude, are they borne on the highest
Alpes? they seeke to scale heauen. Haue they subdued all the Kings of
the earth? they haue quarels to pleade with God, and indeuour to treade
vnder foote his kingdome. They haue no end nor limit, till God laughing
at their vaine purposes, when they thinke themselues at the last step,
thunderstriketh all this presumption, breaking in shiuers their scepters
in their hands, and oftentimes intrapping them in their owne crownes. At
<span class = "pagenum silent">[C2]</span>
<!-- png 018 -->
a word, whatsoeuer happines can be in that ambition promiseth, is but
suffering much ill, to get ill. Men thinke by dayly climing higher to
plucke themselues out of this ill, and the height wherevnto they so
painefully aspire, is the height of misery it selfe. I&nbsp;speake not
heere of the wretchednes of them, who all their life haue held out their
cap to receiue the almes of court fortune, and can get nothing, often
with incredible heart griefe, seeing some by lesse paines taken haue
riches fall into their hands: of them, who iustling one an other to
haue&nbsp;it, loose&nbsp;it, and cast it into the hands of a third: Of
those, who holding it in their hands to hold it faster, haue lost it
through their fingers. Such by all men are esteemed vnhappie, and are
indeed&nbsp;so, because they iudge themselues&nbsp;so. It sufficeth that
all these liberalities which the Deuill casteth vs as out at a windowe,
are but baites: all these pleasures but embushes: and that he doth but
make his sport of&nbsp;vs, who striue one with another for such things,
as most vnhappie is&nbsp;he, that hath best hap to finde them. Well now,
you will say, the Couetouse in all his goodes, hath no good: the
Ambitious at the best he can&nbsp;be, is but ill. But may there not be
some, who supplying the place of Iustice, or being neere about a Prince,
may without following such vnbrideled passions, pleasantly enioy their
goodes, ioyning honor with rest and contentment of minde? Surely in
former ages (there yet remayning among men some sparkes of sinceritie)
in some sort it might be&nbsp;so: but being of that composition they
nowe are, I&nbsp;see not how it may be in any sorte. For deale you in
affayres of estate in these times, either you shall do well, or you
shall do ill. If ill, you haue God for your enemy, and your owne
conscience for a perpetually tormenting executioner. If well, you haue
men for your enemies, and of men the greatest: whose enuie and malice
will spie you out, and
<span class = "pagenum">C2</span>
<!-- png 019 -->
whose crueltie and tyrannie will euermore threaten you. Please the
people you please a beast: and pleasing such, ought to be displeasing to
your selfe. Please your selfe, you displease God: please him, you incurr
a thousand dangers in the world, with purchase of a thousand
displeasures. Whereof it growes, that if you could heare the talke of
the wisest and least discontent of this kinde of men, whether they
speake aduisedly, or their words passe them by force of truth, one would
gladly change garment with his tenaunt: an other preacheth how goodly an
estate it is to haue nothing: a&nbsp;third complaining that his braines
are broken with the noise of Courte or Pallace, hath no other thought,
but as soone as he may to retire himself thence. So that you shall not
see any but is displeased with his owne calling, and enuieth that of an
other: readie neuerthelesse to repent him, if a man should take him at
his word. None but is weerie of the bussinesses wherevnto his age is
subiect, and wisheth not to be elder, to free himselfe of them: albeit
otherwise hee keepeth of olde age as much as in him lyeth.</p>

<p>What must we then doe in so great a contrarietie and confusion of
mindes? Must wee to fynde true humanitie, flye the societie of men, and
hide vs in forrestes among wilde beastes? to auoyde these vnrulie
passions, eschue the assemblye of creatures supposed reasonable? to
plucke vs out of the euills of the world, sequester our selues from the
world? Coulde wee in so dooing liue at rest, it were something.</p>

<p>But alas! men cannot take heerein what parte they woulde: and euen
they which&nbsp;do, finde not there all the rest they sought for. Some
would gladly doo, but shame of the world recalls them. Fooles to be
ashamed of what in their heartes they condemne: and more fooles to be
aduised by the greatest enemye

they can or ought to haue. Others are borne in hande that they ought to
serue the publique, not marking that who counsell them serue only
themselues: and that the more parte would not much seeke the publique,
but that they founde their owne particular. Some are told, that by their
good example they may amende others: and consider not that a hundred
sound men, euen Phisitions themselues, may sooner catch the plague in an
infected towne, then one be healed: that it is but to tempt God, to
enter therein: that against so contagious an aire there is no
preseruatiue, but in getting farre from&nbsp;it. Finally, that as litle
as the freshe waters falling into the sea, can take from it his saltnes:
so little can one <i>Lot</i> or two, or three, reforme a court of
<i>Sodome</i>. And as concerning the wisest, who no lesse carefull for
their soules, then bodies, seeke to bring them into a sound and
wholesome ayre, farre from the infection of wickednes: and who led by
the hande of some Angell of God, retire themselues in season, as
<i>Lot</i> into some little village of <i>Segor</i>, out of the
corruption of the world, into some countrie place from the infected
townes, there quietlie employing the tyme in some knowledge and serious
contemplation: I&nbsp;willinglie yeeld they are in a place of lesse
daunger, yet because they carie the danger, in themselues, not
absolutelie exempt from danger. They flie the court, and a court folowes
them on all sides: they endeuoure to escape the world, and the world
pursues them to death. Hardly in this world can they finde a place where
the world findes them not: so gredelie it seekes to murther them.<br>

sorte or other makes it selfe felt of them. But the worst&nbsp;is, when
we are out of these externall warres and troubles, we finde greater
ciuill warre within our selues: the flesh against the spirite, passion
against reason, earth against heauen, the worlde within vs fighting for
the world, euermore so lodged in the botome of our owne hearts, that on
no side we can flie from&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;will say more: he makes
profession to flie the worlde, who seekes thereby the praise of the
worlde: hee faineth to runne away, who according to the prouerbe, By
drawing backe sets himselfe forward: he refuseth honors, that would
thereby be prayed to take them: and hides him from men to the ende they
shoulde come to seeke him. So the world often harbours in disguised
attire among them that flie the world. This is an abuse. But follow wee
the company of men, the worlde hath his court among them: seeke we the
Deserts, it hath there his dennes and places of resorte, and in the
Desert it selfe tempteth Christ Iesus. Retire wee our selues into our
selues, we find it there as vncleane as any where. Wee can not make the
worlde die in&nbsp;vs, but by dieng our selues. We are in the world, and
the worlde in&nbsp;vs, and to seperate vs from the worlde, wee must
seperate vs from our selues. Nowe this seperation is called Death. Wee
are, wee thinke, come out of the contagious citie, but wee are not
aduised that we haue sucked the bad aire, that wee carry the plague
with&nbsp;vs, that we so participate with&nbsp;it, that through rockes,
through desarts, through mountaines, it euer accompanieth&nbsp;vs.
Hauing auoyded the contagion of others, yet we haue it in our selues. We
haue withdrawen vs out of men: but <ins class = "correction" title = "no space in printed text">not withdrawen</ins> man out of&nbsp;vs. The
tempestuous sea torments&nbsp;vs: we are grieued at the heart, and

winds that blow, the same waues that swel, the same humors that are
stirred. To al no other port, no other mean of tranquilitie but only
death. We were sicke in a chamber neere the street, or neere the market:
we caused our selues to be carried into some backer closet, where the
noise was not so great. But though there the noise was lesse: yet was
the feauer there neuerthelesse: and thereby lost nothing of his heate.
Change bedde, chamber, house, country, againe and againe: we shall euery

times each day bring to our remembrance the garlike &amp; onions of
<i>Egipt</i>. Daily they passe the Ferry with&nbsp;vs: so that both on
this side, and beyond the water, we are in continual combat. Now could
we cassere this cõpany, which eats and gnaws our mind, doubtles we
should be at rest, not in solitarines onely, but euen in the thicket of
men. For the life of mã vpon earth is but a continual warfare. Are we
deliuered from externall practizes? Wee are to take heed of internall
espials. Are the Greekes gone away? We haue a <i>Sinon</i> within, that
wil betray them the place. Wee must euer be waking, hauing an eie to the
watch, and weapons in our hands, if wee will not euery houre be
surprised, &amp; giuen vp to the wil of our enimies. And how at last can
we escape? Not by the woodes, by the riuers, nor by the mountaines: not
by throwing our selues into a presse, nor by thrusting our selues into a
hole. One only meane there&nbsp;is, which is death: which in ende
seperating our spirite from our flesh, the pure and clean part of our
soule from the vncleane, which within vs euermore bandeth it selfe for

perpetuall contention.</p>

<p>And as touching the contentment that may be in the exercises of the
wisest men in their solitarinesse, as reading diuine or prophane Bookes,
with all other knowledges and learnings: I&nbsp;hold well that it is
indeed a far other thing, then are those madde huntings, which make
sauage a multitude of men possessed with these or the like diseases of
the minde. Yet must they all abide the iudgement pronounced by the
wisest among the wise, <i>Salomon</i>, that all this neuerthelesse
applied <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘to / to’ at line break">to</ins> mans naturall disposition, is to him but vanitie and
vexation of minde. Some are euer learning to correct their speach, and
neuer thinke of correcting their life. Others dispute in their Logique
of reason, and the Arte of reason: and loose thereby many times their
naturall reason. One learnes by Arithmetike to diuide to the smallest
fractions, and hath not skill to part one shilling with his brother.
Another by Geometry can measure fields, and townes, and countries: but
can not measure himselfe. The Musitian can accord his voyces, and
soundes, and times togither: hauing nothing in his heart but discordes,
nor one passion in his soule in good tune. The Astrologer lookes vp on
high, and falles in the next ditch: fore-knowes the future, and forgoes
the present: hath often his eie on the heauens, his heart long before
buried in the earth. The Philosopher discourseth of the nature of all
other things: and knowes not himselfe. The Historian can tell of the
warres of <i>Thebes</i> and of <i>Troy</i>: but what is doone in his
owne house can tell nothing. The Lawyer will make lawes for all the
world, and not one for himselfe. The Physition will cure others, and be
blinde in his owne disease: finde the least alteration in his pulse, and
not marke the burning feauers of his minde. Lastlie, the Diuine will
spend the greatest parte of his time in disputing of
<span class = "pagenum silent">[C4v]</span>
<!-- png 024 -->
faith and cares not to heare of charity: wil talke of God, and not
regard to succor men. These knowledges bring on the mind an endlesse
labour, but no contentment: for the more one knowes, the more he would
know.</p>

<p>They pacify not the debates a man feeles in himselfe, they cure not
the diseases of his minde. They make him learned, but they make not him
good: cunning, but not wise. I&nbsp;say more. The more a man knowes, the
more knowes he that he knowes not: the fuller the minde&nbsp;is, the
emptier it findes it selfe: forasmuch as whatsoeuer a man can knowe of
any science in this worlde is but the least part of what he is ignorant:
all his knowledge consisting in knowing his ignorance, al his perfection
in noting his imperfections, which who best knowes and notes, is in
truth among men the most wise, and perfect. In short we must conclude
with <i>Salomon</i>, that the beginning and end of wisedome is the feare
of God: that this wisedome neuerthelesse is taken of the world for meere
folly, and persecuted by the world as a deadly enemy: and that as who
feareth God, ought to feare no euill, for that all his euils are
conuerted to his good: so neither ought he to hope for good in the
worlde, hauing there the deuil his professed enemy, whom the Scripture
termeth Prince of the world.</p>

<p>But with what exercise soeuer we passe the time, behold old age
vnwares to vs coms vpon&nbsp;vs: which whether we thrust our selues into
the prease of men, or hide vs somewhere out of the way, neuer failes to
find vs out. Euery man makes accompt in that age to rest himselfe of all
his trauailes without further care, but to keepe himselfe at ease and in
health. And see contrariwise in this age, there is nothing but an after
taste of all the fore going euils: and most commonly a plentifull
haruest of all such vices as in the whole course of their life, hath
held and possessed them. There you haue the vnabilitie and weakenesse of

torment. There you are recompenced for the trauailes of mind, the
watchings and cares of manhoode, with losse of sight, losse of hearing,
and all the sences one after another, except onely the sence of paine.
Not one parte in vs but death takes in gage to be assured of&nbsp;vs, as

Nothing in vs which will not by and by bee dead: and neuerthelesse our
vices yet liue in&nbsp;vs, and not onely liue, but in despite of nature
daily growe yoong againe. The couetous man hath one foote in his graue,
and is yet burieng his money: meaning belike to finde it againe another
day. The ambitious in his will ordaineth vnprofitable pompes for his
funeralles, making his vice to liue and triumph after his death. The
riotous no longer able to daunce on his feete, daunceth with his
shoulders, all vices hauing lefte him, and hee not yet able to leaue
them. The childe wisheth for youth: and this man laments&nbsp;it. The
yong man liueth in hope of the future, and <ins class = "correction"

present, laments the false pleasures past, and sees for the time to come
nothing to hope for. More foolish then the childe, in bewailing the time
he cannot recall, and not remembring the euill hee had therein: and more
wretched then the yongman, in that after a wretched life not able, but
wretchedly to die, he sees on all sides but matter of dispaire. As for
him, who from his youth hath vndertaken to combate against the flesh,
and against the world: who hath taken so great paines to mortifie
himselfe and leaue the worlde before his time: who besides those
ordinarie euilles findes himselfe vexed with this great and <ins class =

I&nbsp;will not heere speake of the infinite euilles wherewith men in
all ages are annoyed, as losse of friendes and parents, banishments,
exiles, disgraces, and such others, common and ordinarie in the world:

making sorrow for his wifes death, an other for her life, one finding
faulte, that hee is too high in Courte, an other, that hee is not high
enough. The worlde is so full of euilles, that to write them all, woulde
require an other worlde as great as it selfe. Sufficeth, that if the
most happie in mens opinions doe counterpoize his happs with his
mishaps, he shall iudge himselfe vnhappy: and hee iudge him happy, who
had he beene set three dayes in his place, would giue it ouer to him
that came next: yea, sooner then hee, who shall consider in all the
goodes that euer hee hath had the euilles hee hath endured to get them,
and hauing them to retaine and keepe them (I&nbsp;speake of the
pleasures that may be kept, and not of those that wither in a moment)
wil iudge of himselfe, and by himselfe, that the keeping it selfe of the
greatest felicitie in this worlde, is full of vnhappinesse and
infelicitie. Conclude then, that Childhoode is but a foolish
simplicitie, Youth, a&nbsp;vaine heate, Manhoode, a&nbsp;painefull
carefulnesse, and Olde-age, a&nbsp;noysome languishing: that our playes
are but teares, our pleasures, feuers of the minde, our goodes, rackes,
and torments, our honors, heauy vanities, our rest, vnrest: that passing
from age to age is but passing from euill to euill, and from the lesse
vnto the greater: and that alwayes it is but one waue driuing on an
other, vntill we be arriued
<span class = "pagenum">D2</span>
<!-- png 027 -->
at the Hauen of death. Conclude I say, that life is but a wishing for
the future, and a bewailing of the past: a&nbsp;loathing of what wee
haue tasted, and a longing for that wee haue not tasted, a&nbsp;vaine
memorie of the state past, and a doubtfull expectation of the state to
come: finally, that in all our life there is nothing certaine, nothing
assured, but the certaintie and vncertaintie of death. Behold, now comes
Death vnto&nbsp;vs: Behold her, whose approch we so much feare. We are
now to cõsider whether she be such as wee are made beleeue: and whether
we ought so greatly to flie her, as commonly wee&nbsp;do. Wee are
afraide of her: but like little children of a vizarde, or of the Images
of <i>Hecate</i>. Wee haue her in horror: but because wee conceiue her
not such as she&nbsp;is, but ougly, terrible, and hideous: such as it
pleaseth the Painters to represent vnto vs on a wall. Wee flie before
her: but it is because foretaken with such vaine imaginations, wee giue
not our selues leisure to marke her. But staie wee, stande wee stedfast,
looke wee her in the face: wee shall finde her quite other then shee is
painted&nbsp;vs: and altogether of other countenaunce then our miserable
life. Death makes an ende of this life. This life is a perpetuall misery
and tempest: Death then is the issue of our miseries and entraunce of
the porte where wee shall ride in safetie from all windes. And shoulde
wee feare that which withdraweth vs from misery, or which drawes vs into
our Hauen? Yea but you will say, it is a payne to die. Admit it bee: so
is there in curing of a wounde. Such is the worlde, that one euill can
not bee cured but by an other, to heale a contusion, must bee made an
incision. You will say, there is difficultie in the passage: So is there
no Hauen, no Porte, whereinto the entraunce is not straite and
combersome. No good thing is to be bought in this worlde with other then
the coyne of labour and paine. The entraunce indeede is hard, if
<span class = "pagenum silent">[D2v]</span>
<!-- png 028 -->
our selues make it harde, comming thither with a tormented spirite,
a&nbsp;troubled minde, a&nbsp;wauering and irresolute thought. But bring
wee quietnesse of mind, constancie, and full resolution, wee shall not
finde anie daunger or difficultie at all. Yet what is the paine that
death brings&nbsp;vs? Nay, what can shee doe with those paines wee
feele? Wee accuse her of all the euilles wee abide in ending our life,
and consider not howe manie more greeuous woundes or sickenesses wee
haue endured without death: or howe many more vehement paines wee haue
suffered in this life, in the which wee called euen her to our succour.
All the paines our life yeeldes vs at the last houre wee impute to
Death: not marking that life begunne and continued in all sortes of
paine, must also necessarily ende in paine. Not marking (I&nbsp;saie)
that it is the remainder of our life, not death, that
tormenteth&nbsp;vs: the ende of our nauigation that paines&nbsp;vs, not
the Hauen wee are to enter: which is nothing else but a safegarde
against all windes. Wee complayne of Death, where wee shoulde complayne
of life: as if one hauyng beene long sicke, and beginning to bee well,
shoulde accuse his health of his last paynes, and not the reliques of
his disease. Tell mee, what is it else to bee dead, but to bee no more
liuing in the worlde? Absolutelie and simplie not to bee in the worlde,
is it anie payne? Did wee then feele any paine, when as yet wee were
not? Haue wee euer more resemblaunce of Death, then when wee sleepe? Or
euer more rest then at that time? Now if this be no paine, why accuse we
Death of the paines our life giues vs at our departure? Vnlesse also we
wil fondly accuse the time when as yet we were not, of the paines we
felt at our birth<ins class = "correction" title = "printed
upside-down">? </ins>If the comming in be with teares, is it wonder that
such be the going out? If the beginning of our being, be the beginning
of our paine, is it maruell that
<span class = "pagenum">D3</span>
<!-- png 029 -->
such be the ending? But if our not being in times past hath bene without
payne, and all this being contrarywise full of paine: whome should we by
reason accuse of the last paines, the not being to come, or the remnant
of this present being? We thinke we dye not, but when we yeeld vp our
last gaspe. But if we marke well, we dye euery day, euery houre, euery
moment. We apprehend death as a thing vnvsuall to&nbsp;vs: and yet haue
nothing so common in&nbsp;vs. Our liuing is but continuall dyeng: looke
how much we liue, we dye: how much we encrease, our life decreases. We
enter not a step into life, but we enter a step into death. Who hath
liued a third part of his yeares, hath a third part of himselfe dead.
Who halfe his yeares, is already half dead. Of our life, all the time
past is dead, the present liues and dies at once, and the future
likewise shall dye. The past is no more, the future is not yet, the
present&nbsp;is, and no more&nbsp;is. Briefely, this whole life is but a
death: it is as a candle lighted in our bodies: in one the winde makes
it melt away, in an other blowes it cleane out, many times ere it be
halfe burned: in others it endureth to the ende. Howsoeuer it&nbsp;be,
looke how much it shineth, so much it burneth: her shining is her
burning: her light a vanishing smoke: her last fire, hir last wike, and
her last drop of moisture. So is it in the life of man, life and death
in man is all one. If we call the last breath death, so must we all the
rest: all proceeding from one place, and all in one manner. One only
difference there is betweene this life, and that we call death: that
during the one, we haue alwayes wherof to dye: and after the other,
there remaineth only wherof to liue. In summe, euen he that thinketh
death simply to be the ende of man, ought not to feare&nbsp;it: in
asmuch as who desireth to liue longer, desireth to die longer: and who
feareth soone to die, feareth (to speake properlie) lest he may not
longer die.
<span class = "pagenum silent">[D3v]</span>
<!-- png 030 -->

<p>But vnto vs brought vp in a more holy schoole, death is a farre other
thing: neither neede we as the Pagans of consolations against death: but
that death serue&nbsp;vs, as a consolation against all sorts of
affliction: so that we must not only strengthen our selues, as they, not
to feare&nbsp;it, but accustome ourselues to hope for&nbsp;it. For vnto
vs it is not a departing frõ pain &amp; euil, but an accesse vnto all
good: not the end of life, but the end of death, &amp; the beginning of
life. Better, saith <i>Salomon</i>, is the day of death, then the day of
birth, and why? because it is not to vs a last day, but the dawning of
an euerlasting day. No more shall we haue in that glorious light, either
sorow for the past, or expectation of the future: for all shall be there
present vnto&nbsp;vs, and that present shall neuer more passe. No more
shal we powre out our selues in vaine &amp; painfull pleasures: for we
shal be filled with true &amp; substantiall pleasures. No more shal we
paine our selues in heaping togither these exhalatiõs of the earth: for
the heauens shall be ours, and this masse of earth, which euer drawes vs
towards the earth, shalbe buried in the earth. No more shal we
ouerwearie our selues with mounting from degree to degree, and from
honor to honor: for we shall highlie be raysed aboue all heights of the
world; and from on high laugh at the folly of all those we once admired,
who fight together for a point, and as litle childrẽ for lesse then an
apple. No more to be brief shal we haue combates in our selues: for our
flesh shall be dead, and our spirit in full life: our passion buried,
and our reason in perfect libertie. Our soule deliuered out of this
foule &amp; filthie prison, where, by long continuing it is growen into
an habite of crookednes, shall againe draw her owne breath, recognize
her ancient dwelling, and againe remember her former glory &amp;
dignity. This flesh my frend which thou feelest, this body which thou
touchest is not man: Man is from heauen: heauen is his countrie and his
aire. That he is in his body, is but by way of exile &amp; confinement.
Man in deed is soule and
<span class = "pagenum silent">[D4]</span>
<!-- png 031 -->
spirit: Man is rather of celestiall and diuine qualitie, wherin is
nothing grosse nor materiall. This body such as now it&nbsp;is, is but
the barke &amp; shell of the soule: which must necessarily be broken, if
we will be hatched: if we will indeed liue &amp; see the light. We haue
it semes, some life, and some sence in&nbsp;vs: but are so croked and
contracted, that we cannot so much as stretch out our wings, much lesse
take our flight towards heauen, vntill we be disburthened of this
earthlie burthen. We looke, but through false spectacles: we haue eyes
but ouergrowen with pearles: we thinke we see, but it is in a dreame,
wherin we see nothing but deceit. All that we haue, and all that we know
is but abuse and vanitie. Death only can restore vs both life and light:
and we thinke (so blockish we are) that she comes to robbe vs of them.
We say we are Christians: that we beleeue after this mortall,
a&nbsp;life immortall: that death is but a separation of the body and
soule: and that the soule returnes to his happie abode, there to ioy in
God, who only is all good: that at the last day it shall againe take the
body, which shal no more be subiect to corruptiõ. With these goodly
discourses we fill all our bookes: and in the meane while, whẽ it comes
to the point, the very name of death as the horriblest thing in the
world makes vs quake &amp; tremble. If we beleue as we speak, what is
that we feare? to be happy? to be at our ease? to be more content in a
momẽt, then we might be in the longest mortal life that might&nbsp;be?
or must not we of force confesse, that we beleue it but in part? that
all we haue is but words? that all our discourses, as of these hardie
trencher knights, are but vaunting and vanitie? Some you shall see, that
wil say: I&nbsp;know well that I passe out of this life into a better:
I&nbsp;make no doubt of&nbsp;it: only I feare the midway step, that I am
to step ouer. Weak harted creatures! they wil kill thẽselues to get
their miserable liuing: suffer infinite paines, and infinite wounds at
another mans pleasure: passe infinit deaths without dying, for things
<span class = "pagenum silent">[D4v]</span>
<!-- png 032 -->
of nought, for things that perish, and perchance make them perish with
them. But when they haue but one pace to passe to be at rest, not for a
day, but for euer: not an indifferent rest, but such as mans minde
cannot comprehende: they tremble, their harts faile them, they are
affrayde: and yet the ground of their harme is nothing but feare. Let
them neuer tell&nbsp;me, they apprehend the paine: it is but an abuse:
a&nbsp;purpose to conceale the litle faith they haue. No, no, they would
rather languish of the goute, the sciatica, any disease whatsoeuer: then
dye one sweete death with the least paine possible: rather pininglie dye
limme after limme, outliuing as it were, all their sences, motions, and
actions, then speedily dye, immediatly to liue for euer. Let them tell
me no more that they would in this world learne to liue: for euery one
is therevnto sufficiently instructed in himselfe, and not one but is
cunning in the trade. Nay rather they should learne in this world to
dye: and once to dye well, dye dayly in themselues: so prepared, as if
the ende of euery dayes worke, were the ende of our life. Now
contrarywise there is nothing to their eares more offensiue, then to
heare of death. Senseless people! we abandon our life to the ordinarie
hazards of warre, for seauen franks pay: are formost in an assault, for
a litle bootie: goe into places, whence there is no hope of returning,
with danger many times both of bodies and soules. But to free vs from
all hazards, to winne things inestimable, to enter an eternall life, we
faint in the passage of one pace, wherein is no difficultie, but in
opinion: yea we so faint, that were it not of force we must passe, and
that God in despite of vs will doe vs a good turne, hardly should we
finde in all the world one, how vnhappy or wretched soeuer, that would
euer passe. Another will say, had I liued till 50. or 60. yeares,
I&nbsp;should haue bin contented: I&nbsp;should not haue cared to liue
longer: but to dye so yong is no
<span class = "pagenum">E</span>
<!-- png 033 -->
reason, I&nbsp;should haue knowen the world before I had left&nbsp;it.
Simple soule! in this world there is neither young nor olde. The longest
age in comparison of all that is past, or all that is to come, is
nothing: and when thou hast liued to the age thou now desirest, all the
past will be nothing: thou wilt still gape, for that is to come. The
past will yeeld thee but sorrowe, the future but expectation, the
present no contentment. As ready thou wilt then be to redemaund longer
respite, as before. Thou fliest thy creditor from moneth to moneth, and
time to time, as readie to pay the last daye, as the first: thou seekest
but to be acquitted. Thou hast tasted all which the world esteemeth
pleasures: not one of them is new vnto thee. By drinking oftener, thou
shalt be neuer awhit the more satisfyed: for the body thou cariest, like
the bored paile of <i>Danaus</i> daughters, will neuer be full. Thou
mayst sooner weare it out, then weary thy selfe with vsing, or rather
abusing&nbsp;it. Thou crauest long life to cast it away, to spend it on
worthles delights, to mispend it on vanities. Thou art couetous in
desiring, and prodigall in spending. Say not thou findest fault with the
Court, or the Pallace: but that thou desirest longer to serue the
commonwealth, to serue thy countrie, to serue God. He that set thee on
worke knowes vntill what day, and what houre, thou shouldest be
at&nbsp;it: he well knowes how to direct his worke. Should he leaue thee
there longer, perchance thou wouldest marre all. But if he will pay thee
liberally for thy labour, as much for halfe a dayes worke, as for a
whole: as much for hauing wrought till noone, as for hauing borne all
the heate of the day: art thou not so much the more to thanke and prayse
him? but if thou examine thine owne conscience, thou lamentest not the
cause of the widdow, and the orphan, which thou hast left depending in
iudgement: not the dutie
<span class = "pagenum silent">[Ev]]</span>
<!-- png 034 -->
of a sonne, of a father, or of a frend, which thou pretendest thou
wouldest performe: not the ambassage for the common wealth, which thou
wert euen ready to vndertake: not the seruice thou desirest to doe vnto
God, who knowes much better howe to serue himselfe of thee, then thou of
thy selfe. It is thy houses and gardens thou lamentest, thy imperfect
plottes and purposes, thy life (as thou thinkest) imperfect: which by no
dayes, nor yeares, nor ages, might be perfected: and yet thy selfe
mightst perfect in a moment, couldest thou but thinke in good earnest,
that where it ende it skilles not, so that it end well.</p>

<p>Now to end well this life, is onely to ende it willingly: following
with full consent the will and direction of God, and not suffering vs to
be drawen by the necessetie of destenie. To end it willingly, we must
hope, and not feare death. To hope for&nbsp;it, we must certainely looke
after this life, for a better life. To looke for that, wee must feare
God: whome whoso well feareth, feareth indeede nothing in this worlde,
and hopes for all things in the other. To one well resolued in these
points death can be but sweete and agreeable: knowing that through it
hee is to enter into a place of all ioyes. The griefe that may be
therein shall bee allaied with sweetnes: the sufferance of ill,
swallowed in the confidence of good: the sting of Death it selfe shall
bee dead, which is nothing else but Feare. Nay, I&nbsp;wil say more, not
onely all the euilles conceiued in death shall be to him nothing: but he
shall euen scorne all the mishappes men redoubt in this life, and laugh
at all these terrors. For I pray what can he feare, whose death is his
hope? Thinke we to banish him his country? He knows he hath a country
other-where, whence wee cannot banish him: and that all these countries
are but Innes, out of which he must part at the wil of his hoste. To put
him
<span class = "pagenum">E2</span>
<!-- png 035 -->
in prison? a&nbsp;more straite prison he cannot haue, then his owne
body, more filthy, more darke, more full of rackes and torments. To kill
him and take him out of the worlde? that is it he hopes for: that is it
with all his heart he aspires vnto. By fire, by sworde, by famine, by
sickenesse: within three yeeres, within three dayes, within three
houres, all is one to him: all is one at what gate, or at what time he
passe out of this miserable life. For his businesses are euer ended, his
affaires all dispatched, and by what way he shall go out, by the same
hee shall enter into a most happie and euerlasting life. Men can
threaten him but death, and death is all he promiseth himselfe: the
worst they can doe, is, to make him die, and that is the best hee hopes
for. The threatnings of tyrants are to him promises, the swordes of his
greatest enemies drawne in his fauor: forasmuch as he knowes that
threatning him death, they threaten him life: and the most mortall
woundes can make him but immortall. Who feares God, feares not death:
and who feares it not, feares not the worst of this life.</p>

<p>By this reckoning, you will tell me death is a thing to be wished
for: and to passe from so much euill, to so much good, a&nbsp;man
shoulde as it seemeth cast away his life. Surely, I&nbsp;feare not, that
for any good wee expect, we will hasten one step the faster: though the
spirite aspire, the body it drawes with&nbsp;it, withdrawes it euer
sufficiently towardes the earth. Yet is it not that I conclude. We must
seeke to mortifie our flesh in&nbsp;vs, and to cast the world out
of&nbsp;vs: but to cast our selues out of the world is in no sort
permitted&nbsp;vs. The Christian ought willingly to depart out of this
life but not cowardly to runne away. The Christian is ordained by God to
fight therein: and cannot leaue his place without incurring reproch and
infamie. But if it please the grand
<span class = "pagenum silent">[E2v]</span>
<!-- png 036 -->
Captaine to recall him, let him take the retrait in good part, and with
good will obey&nbsp;it. For hee is not borne for himselfe, but for God:
of whome he holdes his life at farme, as his tenant at will, to yield
him the profites. It is in the landlord to take it from him, not in him
to surrender&nbsp;it, when a conceit takes him. Diest thou yong? praise
God as the mariner that hath had a good winde, soone to bring him to the
Porte. Diest thou olde? praise him likewise, for if thou hast had lesse
winde, it may be thou hast also had lesse waues. But thinke not at thy
pleasure to go faster or softer: for the winde is not in thy power, and
in steede of taking the shortest way to the Hauen, thou maiest happily
suffer shipwracke. God calleth home from his worke, one in the morning,
an other at noone, and an other at night. One he exerciseth til the
first sweate, another he sunne-burneth, another he rosteth and drieth
throughly. But of all his he leaues not one without, but brings them all
to rest, and giues them all their hire, euery one in his time. Who
leaues his worke before God call him, looses&nbsp;it: and who importunes
him before the time, looses his reward. We must rest vs in his will, who
in the middest of our troubles sets vs at rest.</p>

<p>To ende, we ought neither to hate this life for the toiles therein,
for it is slouth and cowardise: nor loue it for the delights, which is
follie and vanitie: but serue vs of&nbsp;it, to serue God in&nbsp;it,
who after it shall place vs in true quietnesse, and replenish vs with
pleasures whiche shall neuer more perish. Neyther ought we to flye
death, for it is childish to feare&nbsp;it: and in flieng from&nbsp;it,
wee meete&nbsp;it. Much lesse to seeke&nbsp;it, for that is temeritie:
nor euery one that would die, can die. As much despaire in the one, as
cowardise in the other: in neither any kinde of magnanimitie. It is
enough that we constantly and continually waite for her
<span class = "pagenum silent">[E3]</span>
<!-- png 037 -->
comming, that shee may neuer finde vs vnprouided. For as there is
nothing more certaine then death, so is there nothing more vncertaine
then the houre of death, knowen onlie to God, the onlie Author of life
and death, to whom wee all ought endeuour both to liue and die.</p>
